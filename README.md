# ESNW-Website
Made by: Sian Lauwers First year student Applied computer science at Thomas More Geel
Made for: Nick Witvrouwen / ESNW

My journey:
This is a website for my stepdad his organization ESNW.
This project took me a very long time. I ran into a lot of problems but after 30+ hours of trying different things and talking with my stepdad. He now is content of what the final product is.
I first started with the styling for the website, and we came to a conclusion for making a one-page website since this is the most logical way to go.
After this was over, I started on looking for images that were great for people to look at and tell the difference he makes.
Now I started on making an image slideshow and give a brief description of what he did and who he worked for. This took me probably the longest because it was a lot of try and fail.
After this I started making a calendar that shows the days that he is busy, this took a while because it was the same repetitive thing over and over again.
Now i started filling everything in with information.
This is how my experience went on making this website.
